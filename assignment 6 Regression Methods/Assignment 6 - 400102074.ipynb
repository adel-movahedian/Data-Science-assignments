        "This section implements LASSO regression, a linear model that applies regularization to enhance the selection of relevant features by penalizing less impactful ones. The pipeline begins by standardizing the data to ensure all features have a uniform scale, adds polynomial features to capture nonlinear relationships, and then applies the LASSO regression with specific regularization (alpha=0.01). This method is particularly useful for simplifying models by shrinking less influential feature coefficients to zero.\n",

It also demonstrates the combination of polynomial features and regularization to capture intricate data relationships while maintaining simplicity and interpretability."

        "The kernel trick is a method used in machine learning to efficiently map input data to a higher-dimensional space without explicitly performing the transformation. Instead of calculating the mapping, it uses a kernel function to compute the relationship between data points in the transformed space directly. This enables models, such as Kernel Ridge Regression or Support Vector Machines, to capture complex, nonlinear patterns in the data.\n",

It's computationally efficient and avoids the high costs of working in very high-dimensional spaces explicitly."
